# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.1] - 2025-08-24

### Added
- `FromStr` implementation for all string-like GraphQL scalar types (`ID`, and other AWS scalar types), enabling parsing from string slices:
  ```rust
  let id: ID = "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000".parse().unwrap();
  ```

### Fixed
- Documentation badge in README now correctly links to the latest version instead of hardcoded v0.1.0

[0.6.1]: https://github.com/JeremieRodon/lambda-appsync/compare/v0.6.0...v0.6.1

## [0.6.0] - 2025-04-21

### Added
- New `name_override` option for the `appsync_lambda_main!` macro allowing fine-grained control over generated Rust names:
  ```rust
  appsync_lambda_main!(
      "schema.graphql",
      // Override type names, the struct will be called `GqlPlayer` in Rust
      name_override = Player: GqlPlayer,
      // Override field names, `name` becomes `email` in Rust
      name_override = Player.name: email,
      // Override enum variants, `Python` becomes `Snake`
      name_override = Team.PYTHON: Snake,
      // Handle Rust keywords gracefully, rename to `kind`
      name_override = WeirdFieldNames.type: kind,
  );
  ```

  Do not forget to also override operation return types if you change type names!
- Comprehensive end-to-end integration tests for both batch and non-batch configurations, ensuring non-regression of the full AppSync request processing.

### Changed
- **Major improvement**: Completely revamped compilation error messages for invalid operation handlers:
  - Error messages now point directly to the problematic code instead of the macro invocation
  - Clear indication of expected vs found types for arguments and return values
  - More accurate function signature mismatch reporting

  See [Issue#7](https://github.com/JeremieRodon/lambda-appsync/issues/7) for detailed examples of the improved error messages.
- Internal restructuring of code generation to use trait bounds for signature verification instead of dummy function calls

### Fixed
- Compilation error messages that previously showed inverse type expectations (e.g., for return type mismatches)
- Various edge cases in error reporting related to argument types and counts

### Breaking Changes
- Removed `pub` visibility from `Operation::execute()` as it was not intended for direct use
- Moved some internal types to new module structure. While these weren't meant for direct use, code explicitly referencing them may need updates
- The improved error reporting system may affect existing trybuild tests that were matching against previous error messages

### Internal
- Better module organization with clearer separation between public and internal APIs
- Increased generated code size (approximately 2x) to support better error messages. While this may slightly increase compilation times, it has no runtime performance impact as the additional code is optimized away during compilation.
